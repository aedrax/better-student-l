                       <p>GET YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING DONE WITH EARLY AND SUPPORT A GREAT CAUSE!

Hi everyone,

As I'm sure you have seen Circle K is selling shirts to raise money to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus. (THANK YOU to everyone who has already ordered) So far we have sold 180 shirts and our goal is 200! Please help us meet that goal!

These shirts would be the perfect Christmas presents for sisters, brothers, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, cousins, girlfriends, or just your friends from back home and will be here in plenty of time for Christmas!

Tetanus kills one newborn every 11 minutes but this is actually a very preventable disease when women of child bearing age are given a very affordable and widely accessible vaccination. Since Circle K and Kiwanis has partnered with UNICEF, we have immunized more than 130 million women in over 53 countries and have completely eliminated the disease in 37 countries. Even with so much progress it still remains a major public health risk for many countries.

We would love to have your contribution to help eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus!

There are 2 different surveys below because we could not fit it all into one. Please look at both and then place your order. We will be taking orders until September 28th. After I receive your order I will email you and verify your total.

Please complete the survey and turn in cash or a check, made out to "Circle K International,"  placed in Mariah Steele Unit 3067 before September 28th. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR NAME AND EMAIL ON THE SURVEY.

If you have any questions please feel free to email me!

Help us sell 20 more shirts to meet our goal!
