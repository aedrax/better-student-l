When: Thursday, Sept 10 at 7pm

Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in the U.S. for individuals ages
15-24.  Over 41,000 suicides are reported annually, making it the 10th
leading cause of death for Americans.  It is tragic to consider how many of
these suicides could have been prevented.  Would you know what to say?
Will you be the one that helps?  Join Phi Mu Delta Fraternity and the
Counseling Center's Dr. Mike Schafer and Rebecca Diller on Thursday, Sept
10 at 7pm in Mac Activities to learn the risk factors for suicide, identify
signs of personal crisis, and understand how to get distressed individuals
the help they need.  Be Ready.  Be There.

For questions regarding this event, please contact Andrew Ziegler (

                    <p>Dear ONU Campus Community,

The National Prayer Bus Tour will be making a stop in Ada on September 17th
and 18th.  During the day on the 18th, the members of this prayer team will
be spending time listening to the prayer concerns of students, faculty and
staff on campus and offering prayer for them.

If you would like to meet with members of the prayer team, please stop by
the Chapel sanctuary between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday, September 18th.
Then at 1:00 p.m. we will be have a special send off prayer time for the
team in the Chapel prayer garden. All interested members of the ONU
community are invited to join us at that time.

The National Prayer Bus Tour is organized by the National Day of Prayer
Task Force, and is being brought to our campus through the efforts of a
generous ONU alum.  The tour theme this year is Education, and they will be
stopping at college and university campuses across the country to offer
prayer and encouragement to students and educators at both private and
public institutions.  ONU is one of only two universities in Ohio where the
bus tour will be stopping--the other stop is at Ohio State.

You are welcome to join the prayer team for any part (or all) of their
visit!  If you have any questions, please e-mail me at: d-macdonald@onu.edu

Blessings,

Chaplain David
