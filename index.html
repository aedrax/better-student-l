                        <p>Circle K, a service organization here on campus, is selling shirts and the proceeds will go to UNICEF to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus. Tetanus kills one newborn every 11 minutes but this is actually a very preventable disease when women of child bearing age are given a very affordable and widely accessible vaccination. Since Circle K and Kiwanis has partnered with UNICEF, we have immunized more than 130 million women in over 53 countries and have completely eliminated the disease in 37 countries. Even with so much progress it still remains a major public health risk for many countries.

We would love to have your contribution to help eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus!

There are *2 different surveys* below because we could not fit it all into one. Please look at both and then place your order. We will be taking orders until September 28th. After I receive your order I will email you and verify your total.

Please complete the survey and turn in cash or a check, made out to "Circle K International,"  placed in Mariah Steele Unit 3067 before September 28th. 
If we do not receive payment your order will not be submitted

Your Student Senate is looking for passionate, dedicated polar bears to fill Housing Representative positions. As a Housing Rep, you would get the opportunity to work hands on with all Student Senate sponsored events, to join a committee specializing in areas of concern on campus, and serve as a bridge between students you represent and the University.

If being a Housing Representative interests you, please fill out a Housing Representative Petition and become a candidate! You can find petitions online on the Student Senate website or in the office in the Macintosh center.

We are accepting petitions on a rolling basis until this
Thursday (September 10th). Petitions can be turned in to the Student Senate office. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your participation in Student Senate.
