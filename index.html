                        <p>Hello everyone,

Circle K, a service organization here on campus, is selling shirts and the proceeds will go to UNICEF to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus. Tetanus kills one newborn every 11 minutes but this is actually a very preventable disease when women of child bearing age are given a very affordable and widely accessible vaccination. Since Circle K and Kiwanis has partnered with UNICEF, we have immunized more than 130 million women in over 53 countries and have completely eliminated the disease in 37 countries. Even with so much progress it still remains a major public health risk for many countries.

We would love to have your contribution to help eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus!

There are *2 different surveys* below because we could not fit it all into one. Please look at both and then place your order. We will be taking orders until September 28th. After I receive your order I will email you and verify your total.

Please complete the survey and turn in cash or a check, made out to "Circle K International,"  placed in Mariah Steele Unit 3067 before September 28th. 
If we do not receive payment your order will not be submitted

Part 1:   <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7W3CWMS" class="waves-effect orange waves-light btn black-text">This Link</a>

Part 2:   <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7WHR67C" class="waves-effect orange waves-light btn black-text">This Link</a>

                        <p>Remembering September 11th:


On Friday, our nation will remember the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Many of us on campus can remember where we were when we first heard of the sad events in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.  Many of our students on campus were young schoolchildren or even in preschool at the time.  All of us have been affected by the aftermath of that heartrending day, as we have witnessed heightened security at home and abroad, including deployments of our military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan.


This year, as has become our custom, we will be ringing the Chapel bells at the exact times when the four flights of 9/11 came to their tragic end.
You will hear a single tone from the Chapel carillon at the following times:  

8:46 a.m.  Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center

9:03 a.m.  Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center

9:37 a.m.  Flight 77 crashed into the western fa=C3=A7ade of the Pentagon

10:07 a.m.  Flight 93 crashed in Somerset County, Pennsylvania


I would encourage you to pause for a moment of reflection and prayer as you hear these bells on Friday morning, and remember the sacrifice of those who lost their lives on September 11th: on the planes, in the World Trade Center and Pentagon, and among the New York City fire and police departments.


As always, the Chapel sanctuary, prayer room, and multi-faith room will be open throughout the day for those who wish to pray.


Blessings,

Chaplain David MacDonald

                        <p>Fellow Students,

Your Student Senate is looking for passionate, dedicated polar bears to fill Housing Representative positions. As a Housing Rep, you would get the opportunity to work hands on with all Student Senate sponsored events, to join a committee specializing in areas of concern on campus, and serve as a bridge between students you represent and the University.

If being a Housing Representative interests you, please fill out a Housing Representative Petition and become a candidate! You can find petitions online on the Student Senate website or in the office in the Macintosh center.

We are accepting petitions on a rolling basis until this Thursday (September  10th). Petitions can be turned in to the Student Senate office. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your participation in Student Senate.
