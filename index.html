                       <p>Hi everyone,

As I'm sure you have seen Circle K is selling shirts to raise money to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus. (THANK YOU to everyone who has already ordered) So far we have* sold 119* shirts and our *goal is 200*! Please help us meet that goal!

Tetanus kills one newborn every 11 minutes but this is actually a very preventable disease when women of child bearing age are given a very affordable and widely accessible vaccination. Since Circle K and Kiwanis has partnered with UNICEF, we have immunized more than 130 million women in over 53 countries and have completely eliminated the disease in 37 countries. Even with so much progress it still remains a major public health risk for many countries.

We would love to have your contribution to help eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus!

There are* 2 different surveys below* because we could not fit it all into one. Please look at both and then place your order. We will be taking orders until September 28th. After I receive your order I will email you and verify your total.

Please complete the survey and turn in cash or a check, made out to "Circle K International,"  placed in Mariah Steele Unit 3067 *before September 28th*  .

*PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR NAME AND EMAIL ON THE SURVEY.*

If you have any questions please feel free to email me!

                       <p>Hey guys!
The ONU Polar Robotics club is selling ONU Fan Jerseys as a fundraiser to help us improve the robots we have and build new ones to compete against schools like Notre Dame and Purdue this year. The bookstore does not sell fan jerseys so if you are interested in getting a jersey now is the time to order it! They are 25 each and there is a picture of what they look like on the order form below. The last day to order is September 17th!!!

<a href="https://goo.gl/O1SvjT" class="waves-effect orange waves-light btn black-text">Link</a>

If you want to see what the Jersey will actually look like we will be working at the Mac tables this week Monday, Wednesday Friday from 11-1 and 5-6:30 as well as next week so stop on by to see it if you are interested!

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at m-letizia@onu.edu
Remember these can be worn to support all extracurricular activities!

Go Bears!

                       <p>> Hello all! This year we are excited to announce that there is a new organization on campus. We are Polar Cares: The ONU Affiliate of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. BCEFA has been around for years, raising money to help find a cure for the AIDS disease, as well countless other charities like
Animal Protective Leagues, Women and Children Shelters, and anything in between. Now I know what you're thinking - they are tied into Broadway so it  must be a Theatre organization. Well you're wrong. We want as many people we  can no matter what your major is. If you would like more information, or would
like to join, we will be meetingthis Sunday at 12:00 PM in PAC 131. We all hope to see you there!

                       <p>Dear ONU Campus Community,



Your ONU football team opened the season last week with a strong statement against Utica College. The Polar Bears amassed 530 yards of offense, held the Pioneers to less than 80 yards rushing and our special teams blocked a punt. A complete =E2=80=9Cteam=E2=80=9D win against a quality team from a premier  conference.



This Saturday, we will host Baldwin-Wallace University in Dial-Roberson Stadium at 7:00 pm.



The Yellow Jackets always pose a tough challenge. Your Polar Bears won the 2014 at BW on a touchdown with 9 seconds remaining in the game. Saturday night we have a chance to beat BW in consecutive years for only the 4th time in ONU history. The series began in 1923.



We hope that you can attend the game at 7:00 pm and demonstrate the spirit that makes ONU such a special place. Thanks again for your enthusiasm and support.



For the most current information, video highlights, and updates, you can follow us on Facebook at =E2=80=9COhio Northern University Football=E2=80=9D  


We look forward to seeing you at the game!



Go Polar Bears!
