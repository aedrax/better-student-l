The ONU Polar Robotics club is selling ONU Fan Jerseys as a fundraiser to help us improve the robots we have and build new ones to compete against schools like Notre Dame and Purdue this year. The bookstore does not sell fan jerseys so if you are interested in getting a jersey now is the time to order it! They are 25 each and there is a picture of what they look like on the order form below.

<a href="https://goo.gl/O1SvjT" class="waves-effect orange waves-light btn black-text">This Link</a>

If you want to see what the Jersey will actually look like we will be working at the Mac tables periodically this week and next so stop on by to see one if you are interested!

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at m-letizia@onu.edu
Remember these can be worn to support all extracurricular activities!

Go Bears!

                       <p>Hi everyone,

As I'm sure you have seen Circle K is selling shirts to raise money to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus. So far we have* sold 114* shirts and our *goal is 200*! Please help us meet that goal!

Tetanus kills one newborn every 11 minutes but this is actually a very preventable disease when women of child bearing age are given a very affordable and widely accessible vaccination. Since Circle K and Kiwanis has partnered with UNICEF, we have immunized more than 130 million women in over 53 countries and have completely eliminated the disease in 37 countries. Even with so much progress it still remains a major public health risk for many countries.

We would love to have your contribution to help eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus!

There are* 2 different surveys below* because we could not fit it all into one. Please look at both and then place your order. We will be taking orders until September 28th. After I receive your order I will email you and verify your total.

Please complete the survey and turn in cash or a check, made out to "Circle K International,"  placed in Mariah Steele Unit 3067 *before September 28th* .

*PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR NAME AND EMAIL ON THE SURVEY.*

If you have any questions please feel free to email me!

                       <p>*Winter Break Trip!*

ONU Habitat is hoping to send 20 students to New Orleans over winter break. We sent students on the trip in 2012 and they made a huge impact helping out with Project Homecoming <<a href="http://projecthomecoming.net/" class="waves-effect orange waves-light btn black-text">This Link</a>>. Since we have had a few students back out due to family commitments and travel plans, we still have 10 spots to fill!  If you are interested, please email Nicole Kepner, who will be the trip leader for this journey! She will be able to answer any questions you have. The trip is a great alternative if you are unable to go on a Spring Break trip, too.

Here is the basic info:

                       <p>Dear Campus Community,

Just a reminder that the Pray for America Prayer Bus Tour will arrive on Campus tonight!

Here is a schedule of events:

*9/17  9:00 p.m*.  Prayer Bus team members will be spending time with Northern Christian Fellowship in McIntosh Center.

*9/18  9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m*.  Prayer bus team members will be available for prayer and conversation in the sanctuary of English Chapel.

*9/18  1:00 p.m. * We will have a short send-off prayer time in the Chapel garden, to bless the prayer team as they head off for the next leg of their journey in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Please stop by and see the prayer team during the time they will be available in the Chapel tomorrow.  They will be taking prayer requests and praying with those who wish to receive prayer on the spot.  They will also be taking prayer requests from ONU to their next stop in Michigan,and will be offering prayers for the requests lifted up in their last location in Columbus.

If you have any questions about the prayer bus team, or would like more information, please contact me at: d-macdonald@onu.edu
